About Me
Welcome to my simple "About Me" website! This is a space where I share a bit about myself—who I am, what I do, and what interests me. Whether you're here out of curiosity or just passing through, feel free to explore and learn a little more about me.

This site is intentionally minimal, focusing on clarity and simplicity. No distractions—just a direct look at the person behind the screen.

Thanks for stopping by!
